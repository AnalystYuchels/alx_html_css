## 📄 Project Overview

This project builds upon the **HTML, advanced** concepts by introducing **CSS styling and layout design**. You'll work with an actual designer file provided in Figma and apply advanced styling techniques to bring the page to life.

> 💡 The focus here is not just functionality, but **polished visual presentation** using custom styles.


## 🎯 Objectives

- Apply advanced HTML structure provided in the previous task
- Style the page using custom CSS
- Follow the design specifications available in Figma
- Incorporate images, logos, and fonts as per the design


## 🎨 Figma Design

Access the full page design in Figma here:

- 🔗 [Figma Design File](#)
- 📁 [Download Images Here](#)

To view or edit the design:

1. Log in to your [Figma](https://figma.com) account.
2. Click **"Duplicate to your Drafts"** to unlock full editing and inspect mode.
3. Check layout, spacing, font sizes, and colors.


## 📝 Important Notes

- If your system does not have the required fonts, download them here:
  - [Source Sans Pro](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Source+Sans+Pro)
  - [Spin Cycle OT](https://www.cufonfonts.com/font/spin-cycle-ot)
- Some values in the design file are in **float** (e.g. 13.72px); feel free to **round them** for cleaner CSS.
- You may need to make **modifications to the HTML structure** to match image paths, fonts, or logos provided.
